# About Me

## Hi, My name is Gerson

I'm from currently pursuing a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in Singapore Polytechnic. My telegram id is @SentinelOP.

One of the few reasons why I decided to pursue this module was essentially to learn more about prototyping and the process behind it. It always fascinated me how people can come up with product where they can test and produce in such a short time. And thus, this website will document my journey through this module.
